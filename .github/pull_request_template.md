Fixes #(issue_number)

### Summary

This pr allows the user to insert full spotify links rather than just the id. Also added the functionality to refresh the buttons after the settings window saved the configuration. I needed to refactor the default config and remove the option for `play spotify` dropdown because it was unnecessary.
